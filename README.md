# ABC Trading

Is a simple platform to get trading statistics. 

It consist of two endpoints.
- `/stats` - lets you get stats for given `symbol` passed as symbol URL param and 10^k last tranding prices passed as `k` URL param.
- `/addBatch` - lets you too add batch of trading prices of given symbol. Ordered from oldes to newest.

## How to run 

To run the application use make target `make run` by default it will expose port 8080. You can
configure port or how much data should be colleted for symbol by environment variables. Look at `internal/config/config.go` to 
see what can be changed.

## Stats 

Example request:
``` bash
curl -X GET  http://localhost:8080/stats/?symbol=AAPL&k=3
```

Will return statistics for last 1000 trading prices for symbol "AAPL".

Here is example response
``` bash 
Î» ~> curl -X GET  http://localhost:8080/stats/\?symbol\=A\&k\=3
{"min":0,"max":9,"last":3,"avg":3.923076923076923,"var":7.609467455621303}
```

Response consist of:
- min - Lowest price
- max - Highest price
- last - Latest price seen
- avg - Average price
- var - Variance of prices

## AddBatch

Example request 
``` bash
curl -X POST -d '{"symbol":"AAPL","values":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]}' http://localhost:8080/add_batch/
```

It will add 10 new prices for symbol AAPL. After that next GET request will include statistics for this values.

## About language and framework

This project was written purely in golang without ANY depenency beside using
standard library(OK im using assetion lib for testing purpose, but in app code there is no dependencies :)).
Go is simplistic language that it perfect for writting suchsmall services and it doesn't need anything beside that.

Tests of code are placed in the same directory but in *_test.go directory. You can refer to them
as to examples how to use given parts of the code.

Most of the code is placed in `internal` directory because it blocks using this code as
dependency in different project. I made it on purpose because code is suited only for 
this project and should not be used anywhere else. Nothing here is ready for production usage any anything like that.

All public/exported functions have godoc comments as it is good practice in golang.
